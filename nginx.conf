    # IMPORTANT: Your React app's JavaScript will make calls to your backend.
    # In a Docker Compose setup, your React app (running in its container)
    # needs to know the address of your backend container.
    #
    # During local Docker Compose development, the backend service is named 'backend'
    # and it's exposed on port 8080. From your host, it's localhost:8080.
    #
    # You will configure your React app's API client (e.g., Axios) to call:
    # `http://localhost:8080/api` (for local development, if Nginx isn't proxying API calls)
    # OR `http://backend:8080/api` (if Nginx *was* proxying, but generally
    # React directly calling host-exposed port is simpler for local Docker Compose)
    #
    # FOR PRODUCTION: This URL would change to your public backend URL.
